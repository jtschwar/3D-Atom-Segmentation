## 3D-Atom-Segmentation (Legacy)

This repository implements 3D convolutional neural network augmentation of atomic resolution electron tomograms using UNet architectures. The two modified artictectures used in this package are:
 1. [Accurate and versatile 3D segmentation of plant tissues at cellular resolution](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.57613) - Adrian Wolny et al
 2. [R2U3D: Recurrent Residual 3D U-Net for Lung Segmentation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9456956) - Dhaval Kadia. 

This package uses experimental reconstructions and labeled coordinates from data available through the following publications:

  1. [Deciphering chemical order/disorder and material properties at the single-atom level](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature21042)
  2. [Observing crystal nucleation in four dimensions using atomic electron tomography](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1317-x)
  3. [Determining the three-dimensional atomic structure of an amorphous solid](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03354-0)
  4. [Three-dimensional atomic packing in amorphous solids with liquid-like structure](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-021-01114-z)
  5. [Simultaneous Successive Twinning Captured by Atomic Electron Tomography](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsnano.1c07772?goto=supporting-info)
